In January 2025, [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) unveiled their new DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek R1 models.
It took the [world][deepseek_cnn] [by][deepseek_tech] [storm][deepseek_hackernews].
Users were impressed with its abilities on top of their claims that is was up to 50&times; more efficient to train and run than their competitors.

[DeepSeek_R1]: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1
[DeepSeek_V2]: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-VL2
[DeepSeek_V3]: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3

They also released multiple papers 
([DeepSeek-V2][DeepSeek_V2], [DeepSeek-V3][DeepSeek_V3], [DeepSeek-R1][DeepSeek_R1])
with an impressive array of new techniques across the whole machine learning pipeline, from high level theory to intricate implementation details.
Most of it built on existing ideas in innovative ways. They include:
- Theory
    - Multi-Head Latent Attention: reduce memory usage during inference.
    - DeepSeekMoE: segmented and isolated mixture of experts. 
    - Multi-token prediction.
    - Reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization but without supervised data. 
    - Improved chain-of-thought reasoning.
- Implementation
    - DualPipe: accelerate training by overlapping forward and backward computation communication phases.
    - Exponential moving average on the CPU.
    - Mixed precision floating point numbers during training. FP8 and FP32 are used.
    - Low-precision storage and communication.

The aim of this post is to explore one of these ideas in depth, namely Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), which reduces memory during inference.

[Attention_2017]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762
[RoPE_2021]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864
[LoRA_2021]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685

As we will see, MLA actually combines 3 ideas:
1. Attention and multi-head attention from [Attention is all you need (2017)][Attention_2017].
2. KV Caching.
3. Low-Rank Adaption matrices (LoRA) from [LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models (2021)][LoRA_2021].

This article assumes you have some exposure to these techniques already.

DeepSeek also adds two enhancements:
<ol start="1">
  <li>Weight absorption.</li>
  <li>Decoupled rotary position embeddings (RoPE) from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864">RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding (2021)</a>.</li>
</ol>

While the DeepSeek paper only speaks good of these, they complicate the mathematics and require specialised optimised code to see real performance gains.

		Julia uses column major format whereas Python uses row major format. In Julia sample vectors are columns while in Python they are rows.
		Equations between the two formats will look backwards to each other.
		They need to be transposed and definitions also need to be transposed. 
		E.g. $K^TQ \rightarrow (K_c^TQ_c)^T=Q_c^TK_c= Q_r K_r^T$
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

The original source code is written in Python with the PyTorch machine learning framework.
However, my favourite language is Julia and continuing with my previous posts on transformers, all the code here is written in Julia using the Flux.jl machine learning framework.
The mathematics therefore follows Julia's columnar major format and not Python's row major format.
In this format each column represents a single sample. The second dimension is sequence length and all remaining dimensions represent batches.

<h2 id="kv-caching">2 KV Caching</h2>
<h3 id="kv-caching-theory">2.1 Theory</h3>

[KVCache_visual]: https://medium.com/@joaolages/kv-caching-explained-276520203249
[ZeroToHero]:https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html

There is an inefficiency in using transformers for generation.
In classification [use cases](/machine-learning/2022/05/18/transformers#use-case-amazon-reviews), the model only needs to calculate attention over the input sentence once (per layer) before making its prediction.
But in text generation, it needs to recalculate it over the entire sentence.
One analogy I read is that this is like having to reread the entire sentence so far in order to produce the next word and then rereading again to produce the next word, and so on.

In mathematical terms, this requires computing the attention between the first token and itself, between the first two tokens, between the first 3 tokens and so on until it's between all the tokens, and repeating this whole process each time for every new token.
This was the case for the [generator][generator] I made based on Andrej Karpathy's [Zero to Hero course][ZeroToHero].

It would be better to have a "memory" of what has been generated so far.
This is where the KV cache comes in, for Key-Value cache.
We can store the previous keys and values and use them to calculate the new attention value.
This will give the exact same value as recalculating the entire attention.

Here is a mathematical proof.
For a visual interpretation, please see Jo√£o Lages' [excellent article][KVCache_visual].

The attention equation is

$$
    A = V\text{softmax}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_h}}K^T Q\right)
\label{eq:attention}
\tag{2.1.1}
$$

where

$$
\begin{align}
    K &= W^K X \\
    Q &= W^Q X \\
    V &= W^V X
\end{align}
\label{eq:KQV}
\tag{2.1.2}
$$

where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{d\times n \times B}$ and $W^K, W^Q, W^V \in \mathbb{R}^{d_hH \times d}$.

Focusing on one head in one batch with dimension $d_h$, the input matrix $X$ is split into the first $n-1$ columns and the $n$th column.
The first multiplication can then be written as (dimensional analysis on right):[^forgive]

$$
\begin{align}
S &= K^T Q & & \\
  &=
\begin{bmatrix}
K_{1:n-1} & K_n 
\end{bmatrix}^T
\begin{bmatrix}
Q_{1:n-1} & Q_n
\end{bmatrix}
&; &\begin{bmatrix}d_h \times (n-1) & d_h \times 1 \end{bmatrix} ^T \begin{bmatrix} d_h \times (n-1) & d_h \times 1\end{bmatrix}\\
 &=
\begin{bmatrix}
K_{1:n-1}^T \\ K_n^T 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
Q_{1:n-1} & Q_n
\end{bmatrix} &; &\begin{bmatrix}(n-1) \times d_h \\ 1 \times d_h \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} d_h \times (n-1) & d_h \times 1\end{bmatrix}\\
 &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
K_{1:n-1}^T Q_{1:n-1} & K_{1:n-1}^T Q_n \\
K_n^T Q_{1:n-1} & K_n^T Q_n
\end{bmatrix} &; &\begin{bmatrix}(n-1)\times(n-1) & (n-1)\times 1 \\ 1 \times (n-1) & 1\times 1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\label{eq:Kcache}
\tag{2.1.3}
$$

Looking at the final line, the first $(n-1)$ columns can be safely dropped without affecting the $n$th column.
(We would do this anyway in [generation](/machine-learning/2024/03/23/transformers-gpt#generation).)
The $n$th column only depends on $K_{1:n-1}$, $K_n$ and $Q_n$.
Of these, $K_{1:n-1}$ will come from the cache and the other two will be calculated from $X_n$.

<div class="message-container info-message">
	<div class="message-icon fa fa-fw fa-2x fa-exclamation-circle">
	</div>
	<div class="content-container">
		<div class="message-body">
    It is important to note that dropping the first $(n-1)$ columns is also valid because almost all other layers in a transformer are independent of position.
    For example for the dense layers $Y=WX$, permuting the columns of $X$ will result in a corresponding permutation of the columns of $Y$.
    E.g. if $X$ has two columns and $[Y_1 Y_2] = W[X_1 X_2]$ then $[Y_2 Y_1] = W[X_2 X_1]$
    The exception is the position embedding layers which will require a new parameter to be passed through the whole transformer to indicate the position.
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

Similarly for the next multiplication we have ($Z=\text{softmax}(S)$):

$$
\begin{align}
A &= V Z \\
  &=
\begin{bmatrix}
V_{1:n-1} & V_n 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
Z_{1:n-1,1:n-1} & Z_{1:n-1,n} \\
Z_{n,1:n-1} & Z_{n,n} 
\end{bmatrix} \\
 &= 
 \begin{bmatrix}
    V_{1:n-1} Z_{1:n-1,1:n-1} +  V_{n} Z_{n,1:n-1}  &
    V_{1:n-1} Z_{1:n-1,n} + V_n Z_{n, n}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\label{eq:Vcache}
\tag{2.1.4}
$$

However, we said we are dropping the first $(n-1)$ columns.
Without them only the $n$th column is calculated.
Hence we have:

$$
\begin{align}
A_n &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
V_{1:n-1} & V_n 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
Z_{1:n-1,n} \\
Z_{n,n} 
\end{bmatrix} \\
  &= V_{1:n-1} Z_{1:n-1,n} + V_n Z_{n, n}
\end{align}
\tag{2.1.5}
$$

which depends on $V_{1:n-1}$, which will come from the cache, and $V_n$, which will be calculated from $X_n$.

There will be two caches each with size $d_h H \times N \times B$ for $H$ heads, a maximum sequence length of $N$ and a maximum batch size of $B$.
The total cache size can grow very large for large transformers with many multi-head attention layers.
The primary aim of MLA is to reduce the size of this cache. That will covered in the next section.

<h3 id="kv-caching-code">2.2 Code</h3>

Building on my code in [TransformersLite.jl], it is straightforward to create a new `MultiHeadAttentionKVCache` layer with two caches:

{% highlight julia %}
struct MultiHeadAttentionKVCache{
    Q<:Dense, K<:Dense, V<:Dense, O<:Dense, C<:Array{T, 3}  where T
    }
    nhead::Int
    denseQ::Q
    denseK::K
    denseV::V
    denseO::O
    cache_k::C
    cache_v::C
end

Flux.@layer trainable=(denseQ, denseK, denseV, denseO)
{% endhighlight %}

The forward pass calculates the current `q`, `k` and `v` values from the input and gets the rest from the cache.
It then continues without any additional modifications from the original code:

{% highlight julia %}
function (mha::MultiHeadAttentionKVCache)(
    query::A3, key::A3, value::A3
    ; start_pos::Int=1, use_cache::Bool=true, kwargs...
    ) where {T, A3 <: AbstractArray{T, 3}}
    q = mha.denseQ(query) # size(q) == (dh, 1, B)
    k = mha.denseK(key)
    v = mha.denseV(value) # size(k) == size(v) == (dh, 1, B)
    if use_cache
        dim, seq_length, batch_dim = size(query)
        end_pos = start_pos + seq_length - 1
        mha.cache_k[:, start_pos:end_pos, 1:batch_dim] = k
        mha.cache_v[:, start_pos:end_pos, 1:batch_dim] = v
        K = mha.cache_k[:, 1:end_pos, 1:batch_dim]
        V = mha.cache_v[:, 1:end_pos, 1:batch_dim]
    else
        K = k
        V = v
    end
    A, scores = multi_head_scaled_dot_attention(mha.nhead, q, K, V; kwargs...)
    mha.denseO(A), scores
end
{% endhighlight %}

Here is a small example of it in action. (For the full code, see [test/MultiHeadAttention.jl](https://github.com/LiorSinai/TransformersLite.jl/blob/feature/mla/test/MultiHeadAttention.jl).)

Create the layer and inputs:
{% highlight julia %}
using TransformersLite
using TransformersLite: MultiHeadAttention, MultiHeadAttentionKVCache
using TransformersLite: make_causal_mask, clone_add_kv_cache
nhead, dim_model, dim_out = 4, 32, 13
mha = MultiHeadAttention(nhead, dim_model, dim_out) 
mha = clone_add_kv_cache(mha, 64, 8)
X = randn(Float32, 32, 10, 5)
{% endhighlight %}

Fill the cache:
{% highlight julia %}
mask = make_causal_mask(ones(10, 10))
A, scores = mha(X, X, X; mask=mask, start_pos=1, use_cache=true)
size(A) # (13, 10, 5)
size(scores) # (10, 10, 4, 5)
{% endhighlight %}

Use the cache with a new vector:
{% highlight julia %}
x = randn(Float32, 32, 1, 5)
mask = repeat([true], inner=(11, 1))
Ax, scoresx = mha(x, x, x; mask=mask, start_pos=11, use_cache=true)
size(Ax) # (13, 1, 5)
size(scoresx) # (11, 1, 4, 5)
{% endhighlight %}

Compare without the cache:
{% highlight julia %}
Xx = cat(X, x, dims=2)
mask = make_causal_mask(ones(11, 11))
AXx, scoresXx = mha(Xx, Xx, Xx; mask=mask, start_pos=1, use_cache=false)
isapprox(AXx[:, end, :], Ax[:, end, :]) # true
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 id="multi-head-latent-attention">3 Multi-Head Latent Attention</h2>
<h3 id="mla-cache">3.1 C cache</h3>

We've seen that the KV cache has size $2d_h H \times N \times B$ bytes per multi-head attention layer.
The aim of MLA is to reduce this, specifically to $d_c \times N \times B$ bytes per multi-head attention layer.
Therefore we will choose $d_c < 2d_h H$.

<figcaption>Different KV caching techniques.</figcaption>
</figure>

[DeepSeek][DeepSeek_V2]'s innovation is to introduce a weight matrix $W^{DKV} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_c\times d}$ to compress the input $X \in \mathbb{R}^{d\times n}$ to a lower rank matrix $C^{KV} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_c \times n}$.
This $C^{KV}$ matrix is then stored in the cache.
Then two other weight matrices $W^{UK}$ and $W^{UV} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_h H\times d_c}$ uncompress the same $C^{KV}$ matrix to the key $K$ and value $V$ respectively. The above [figure](#fig-mla) shows this visually.

$$
\begin{align}
C^{KV} &= W^{DKV} X \\
K &= W^{UK} C^{KV} \\
V &= W^{UV} C^{KV}
\end{align}
\tag{3.1.1}
\label{eq:mla}
$$

The KV cache is now replaced with a $C^{KV}$ cache of size $d_c \times N \times B$.
DeepSeek theorises that this compression also results in a regularization effect that improves performance.
This is supported by other LoRA research.

Note that there are now three matrix multiplications to perform comprising of $2(2d_hH + d)d_c nB$ scalar operations 
instead of two comprising of $4(d_h H)d n B$ operations.[^matrix_complexity]
With the standard $d = d_h H$ and a compression ratio $r=\tfrac{d_h H}{d_c}$, the ratio of operations with MLA compared to MHA is $\tfrac{3}{r}$.
Therefore this requires $r>3$ for a performance boost too.
(DeepSeek does not mention this in their paper.)

DeepSeek-V3 uses $d_h = 128$, $H=128$ and $d_c=4 d_h = 512$ which means it has a compression ratio of $32$ and a 10&times; speed up.

To reduce memory during training and to get the same regularization affect, DeepSeek also applies the same strategy to the query:

$$
\begin{align}
C^{Q} &= W^{DQ} X \\
Q &= W^{UQ} C^{Q}
\end{align}
\tag{3.1.2}
\label{eq:cq}
$$

DeepSeek give further enhancements to this which will be described shortly.
They also apply layer normalisation to $C^Q$ and $C^{KV}$ which I will ignore in this article.
For now, lets see this basic version of MLA in action.

<h3 id="mla-code">3.2 Code </h3>

First create a struct similar to the `MultiHeadAttentionKVCache` layer.

{% highlight julia %}
struct MultiHeadLatentAttention{D1<:Dense, D2<:Dense, A<:AbstractArray{T, 3} where T} 
    nhead::Int
    denseDQ::D1
    denseUQ::D1
    denseDKV::D1
    denseUK::D1
    denseUV::D1
    denseO::D2
    cache_ckv::A
end

Flux.@layer MultiHeadLatentAttention trainable=(denseDQ, denseUQ, denseDKV, denseUK, denseUV, denseO)
{% endhighlight %}

Here is a convenience constructor to construct it from the various input dimensions:
{% highlight julia %}
function MultiHeadLatentAttention(;
    nhead::Int, dim_in::Int, dim_head::Int, dim_lora, dim_out::Int,
    max_seq_length::Int, max_batch_size::Int
    )
    denseDQ = Dense(dim_in => dim_lora; bias=false)
    denseUQ = Dense(dim_lora => dim_head * nhead; bias=false)
    denseDKV = Dense(dim_in => dim_lora; bias=false)
    denseUK = Dense(dim_lora => dim_head*nhead; bias=false)
    denseUV = Dense(dim_lora => dim_head*nhead; bias=false)
    denseO = Dense(dim_head*nhead => dim_out; bias=false)
    cache_ckv = Array{Float32, 3}(undef, dim_lora, max_seq_length, max_batch_size)
    MultiHeadLatentAttention(
        nhead,
        denseDQ, denseUQ,
        denseDKV, denseUK, denseUV,
        denseO,
        cache_ckv
    )
end
{% endhighlight %}

The forward pass is:
{% highlight julia %}
function (mla::MultiHeadLatentAttention)(query::A3, key::A3
    ; start_pos::Int=1, use_cache::Bool=true, mask::Union{Nothing, M}=nothing
    ) where {T, A3 <: AbstractArray{T, 3}, M <: AbstractArray{Bool}}
    dm, seq_length, batch_dim = size(key)
    cq = mla.denseDQ(key)     # size(cq) == (dc, dq, B)
    ckv = mla.denseDKV(query) # size(ckv) == (dc, dkv, B)
    if use_cache
        end_pos = start_pos + seq_length - 1
        mla.cache_ckv[:, start_pos:end_pos, 1:batch_dim] = ckv
        ckv = mla.cache_ckv[:, 1:end_pos, 1:batch_dim]
    end
    K = mla.denseUK(ckv) # size(k) == (dh*nhead, dkv, B)
    V = mla.denseUV(ckv) # size(v) == (dh*nhead, dkv, B)
    Q = mla.denseUQ(cq)  # size(q) == (dh*nhead, dq, B)
    A, scores = multi_head_scaled_dot_attention(mla.nhead, Q, K, V; mask=mask)
    A = mla.denseO(A)
    A, scores
end
{% endhighlight %}

Create a test layer with compression ratio $\tfrac{d_hH}{d_c}=4$:
{% highlight julia %}
nhead, dim_head, dim_lora, dim_out = 8, 64, 128, 8*64
dim_model = nhead * dim_head
N, max_seq_length, batch_dim = 20, 32, 8
mla = MultiHeadLatentAttention(
    nhead=nhead, dim_in=dim_model, dim_head=div(dim_model, nhead),
    dim_lora=dim_lora, dim_out=dim_out,
    max_seq_length=max_seq_length, max_batch_size=batch_dim
    )
X0 = randn(Float32, dim_model, N, batch_dim)
{% endhighlight %}

Fill the cache:
{% highlight julia %}
mask = make_causal_mask(ones(N, N));
A, scores = mla(X0, X0; mask=mask, use_cache=true); 
size(A) # (512, 20, 8)
size(scores) # (20, 20, 8, 8)
{% endhighlight %}

Use the cache with a new vector:
{% highlight julia %}
x = randn(Float32, dim_model, 1, batch_dim)
mask = repeat([true], inner=(N + 1, 1))
Ax, scoresx = mla(x, x; mask=mask, start_pos=N+1, use_cache=true)
size(Ax) # (512, 1, 8)
size(scoresx) # (21, 1, 8, 8)
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="mla-absorption">3.3 Absorption</h3>

DeepSeek suggests a way to decrease the computational cost by absorbing weight matrices into each other.
To quote [DeepSeek][DeepSeek_V2] directly:

> In addition, during inference, since $W^{UK}$ can be absorbed into $W^{Q}$ , and $W^{UV}$ can be absorbed
into ${W^O}$, we even do not need to compute keys and values out for attention.

What they mean is that the weight matrices can be multiplied to produce a single weight matrix.
This can only be done during inference because during training they need to be kept separate so that the gradients flow properly backwards through each matrix.

This technique can be used independently of MLA.

To show why this works, rewrite the attention equation $\ref{eq:attention}$ as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
S &= K^T{Q} \\
  &= (W^{UK}C^{KV})^T (W^{UQ}C^Q) \\
  &= (C^{KV})^T (W^{UK})^T W^{UQ} C^{Q} \\
  &= (C^{KV})^T W^{KQ} C^{Q} \quad ; W^{KQ}=(W^{UK})^T W^{UQ}
\end{align}
\label{eq:absorbWKQ}
\tag{3.3.1}
$$

This looks straightforward but there are further complications with the dimensions.
Here is a dimensional analysis of the above equation following the two rules of batch matrix multiplication:
1. The inner matrix dimensions must match. That is, the second dimension of the first matrix must match the first dimension of the second.
2. All the batch dimensions (dimensions 3 and greater) must be equal.

$$
\begin{align}
& (d_c \times n \times B)^T (d_h H \times d_c)^T (d_h H \times d_c) (d_c \times n \times B) \\
&= (n \times d_c \times B) (d_c \times d_h \times H) (d_h \times d_c \times H) (d_c \times n \times B) \\
&= (n \times d_c \times B) (d_c \times d_c \times H) (d_c \times n \times B) \\
&= (n \times d_c \times 1 \times B) (d_c \times d_c \times H \times 1) (d_c \times n \times 1 \times B) \\
&= n \times n \times H \times B
\end{align}
\label{eq:absorbWQ_dimension}
\tag{3.3.2}
$$

where

- Line 2 reshapes the weight matrices  from $d_h H \times d_c$ to $d_h \times d_c \times H$. This is necessary because the non-linear softmax function must be applied independently over each head dimension.
- Line 3 shows that $W^{KQ} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_c \times d_c \times H}$.
- Line 4 adds extra broadcast dimensions to make the batch dimensions match.

Broadcasting is a technique where the smaller array is replicated along all dimensions of size 1 to match the size of the larger array.
For broadcasted batched multiplication this only needs to be done for the 3rd and higher dimensions.
Pseudo-code for this is:

<div id="pseudo-broadcast-batch-mul">
<blockquote>
<u><b>Broadcasted batched multiplication</b></u> <br>

This same absorption technique can be applied to the value and output matrices:
$$
\begin{align}
Y &= W^O V Z \\
  &= W^O (W^{UV} C^{KV} Z) \\
  &= W^{OV} C^{KV} Z
\end{align}
\label{eq:absorbOV}
\tag{3.3.3}
$$

The dimensional analysis here is similar:

$$
\begin{align}
& (d_o \times d_h H) (d_h H \times d_c) (d_c \times n \times B) (n \times n \times H \times B) \\
&= (d_o \times d_h \times H) (d_h \times d_c \times H) (d_c \times n \times 1 \times B) (n \times n \times H \times B)\\
&= (d_o \times d_h \times H) (d_h \times d_c \times H) (d_c \times n \times H \times B) \\
&= (d_o \times d_c \times H) (d_c \times n \times H \times B) \\
&= (d_o \times d_c H) (d_c H \times n \times B) \\
&= d_o \times n \times B
\end{align}
\label{eq:absorbOV_dimension}
\tag{3.3.4}
$$

This shows that the $C^{KV} Z$ multiplication is a broadcasted batched multiplication.
However where $W^{KQ} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_c \times d_c \times H}$, $W^{OV} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_o \times d_c H}$ is a typical 2D matrix.
Therefore the usual matrix multiplication can be applied by reshaping the $C^{KV} Z$ result from a 3D $d_c H \times n \times B$ array to a $d_c H \times nB$ matrix.

[einsum]: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.einsum.html

I have written an implementation in Julia directly based on the [pseudo code](#pseudo-broadcast-batch-mul).
It can be seen here: [broadcasted_batched_mul.jl](https://github.com/LiorSinai/TransformersLite.jl/blob/feature/mla/src/broadcasted_batched_mul.jl).
However, it is inefficient and uses scalar indexing which is extremely slow on a GPU.

My solution instead is to physically replicate the broadcasted dimensions.
This is of course inefficient compared to virtual replication but it makes the function viable on a GPU.
The downside is it can be up to 4&times; slower than the naive code on a CPU.

{% highlight julia %}
using Flux: batched_mul
function broadcasted_batched_mul(x::AbstractArray{T, N}, y::AbstractArray{T, N}) where {T, N}
    batch_dims_x = Tuple(size(x, idx) == 1 ? size(y, idx) : 1 for idx in 3:N)
    dims_x = (1, 1, batch_dims_x...)
    batch_dims_y = Tuple(size(y, idx) == 1 ? size(x, idx) : 1 for idx in 3:N)
    dims_y = (1, 1, batch_dims_y...)
    xb = repeat(x; outer=dims_x)
    yb = repeat(y; outer=dims_y)
    batched_mul(xb, yb)
end
{% endhighlight %}

The DeepSeek [source code][DeepSeek_V3] meanwhile uses [torch.einsum][einsum] and carries out the multiplications right to left instead of creating a new matrix.[^tensors]
Here is the relevant code.
As far as I know, this has the same drawbacks with scalar indexing with none of the advantages of absorption as described in their paper.

{% highlight python %}
q = self.wq_b(self.q_norm(self.wq_a(x)))
q = q.view(bsz, seqlen, self.n_local_heads, self.qk_head_dim)
kv = self.wkv_a(x)
wkv_b = self.wkv_b.weight 
wkv_b = wkv_b.view(self.n_local_heads, -1, self.kv_lora_rank)
q = torch.einsum("bshd,hdc->bshc", q, wkv_b)
self.kv_cache[:bsz, start_pos:end_pos] = self.kv_norm(kv)
scores = torch.einsum("bshc,btc->bsht", q, self.kv_cache[:bsz, :end_pos])
{% endhighlight %}

[FlashMLA]: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/FlashMLA

Presumably fast MLA implementions for GPU kernels would make use of virtual replication.
(It would great if someone can clarify what [FlashMLA][FlashMLA] does.)

<h3 id="mla-absorption-code">3.5 Code </h3>

I will detail some of the code here. For the full code, see [MultiHeadLatentAttention.jl](https://github.com/LiorSinai/TransformersLite.jl/blob/feature/mla/src/MultiHeadLatentAttention.jl).

The first step is create the $W^{KQ}$ and $W^{OV}$ matrices.

First, $W^{KR}=(W^{UK})^T W^{UQ}$ while reshaping from $d_h H \times d_c$ to $d_h \times d_c \times H$.
{% highlight julia %}
function _absorb_WUK_WUQ(nhead::Int, W_UK::AbstractMatrix, W_UQ::AbstractMatrix)
    dh = div(size(W_UK, 1), nhead)
    dim_lora = size(W_UK, 2)
    W_UQ = permutedims(reshape(W_UQ, dh, nhead, dim_lora), (1, 3, 2)) 
    W_UK = permutedims(reshape(W_UK, dh, nhead, dim_lora), (1, 3, 2))
    W_UKT = permutedims(W_UK, (2, 1, 3)) # (dh, dc, nhead)^T => (dc, dh, nhead)
    batched_mul(W_UKT, W_UQ) 
end
W_KQ = _absorb_WUK_WUQ(nhead, denseUK.weight, denseUQ.weight)
{% endhighlight %}

Then $W^{OV}=W^O W^{UV}$ while preserving the head dimension through reshaping:
{% highlight julia %}
function _absorb_WO_WUV(nhead::Int, W_O::AbstractMatrix, W_UV::AbstractMatrix)
    dh = div(size(W_UV, 1), nhead)
    dim_lora = size(W_UV, 2)
    dout = size(W_O, 1)
    W_UVh = permutedims(reshape(W_UV, dh, nhead, dim_lora), (1, 3, 2)) # (dh*nhead, dc) => (dh, dc, nhead)
    W_Oh = reshape(W_O, dout, dh, nhead) # (dout, dh*nhead) => (dout, dh, nhead)
    W_OVh = batched_mul(W_Oh, W_UVh) # (dout, dh, nhead) * (dh, dc, nhead)
    reshape(W_OVh, dout, dim_lora*nhead) # (dout, dc, nhead) => (dout, dc*nhead)
end
W_OV = _absorb_WO_WUV(nhead, denseO.weight, denseUV.weight)
{% endhighlight %}

The forward pass starts the same as in the original [code](#mla-code) until the end of caching:

{% highlight julia %}
function mla_absorb(
    mla::MultiHeadLatentAttention, query::A3, key::A3
    ; start_pos::Int=1, use_cache::Bool=true, mask::Union{Nothing, M}=nothing
    ) where {T, A3 <: AbstractArray{T, 3}, M <: AbstractArray{Bool}}
    dm, seq_length, batch_dim = size(key)
    dh = div(dm, mla.nhead)
    cq = mla.norm_cq(mla.denseDQ(key))      # size(cq) == (dc, dq, B)
    ckv = mla.norm_ckv(mla.denseDKV(query)) # size(ckv) == (dc, dkv, B)
    if use_cache
        end_pos = start_pos + seq_length - 1
        mla.cache_ckv[:, start_pos:end_pos, 1:batch_dim] = ckv
        ckv = mla.cache_ckv[:, 1:end_pos, 1:batch_dim]
    end
{% endhighlight %}

Then add the broadcast dimensions:
{% highlight julia %}
    ckv_ = Flux.unsqueeze(ckv, dims=3)
    keyT = permutedims(ckv_, (2, 1, 3, 4)) # (dkv, dc, B) => (dkv, dc, 1, B)
    cq_ = Flux.unsqueeze(cq, dims=3) # (dkv, dc, B) => (dkv, dc, 1, B)
    W_KQ = Flux.unsqueeze(mla.W_KQ, dims=4); # (dc, dc, nhead) => (dc, dc, nhead, 1)
{% endhighlight %}

Then apply the equations as before except using `broadcasted_batched_mul` instead of `batched_mul`:
{% highlight julia %}
    atten_base = broadcasted_batched_mul(keyT, broadcasted_batched_mul(W_KQ, cq_))
    atten = one(T)/convert(T, sqrt(dh)) .* (atten_base)
    atten = apply_mask(atten, mask)
    scores = softmax(atten; dims=1)
    A = broadcasted_batched_mul(ckv_, scores) # (dc, dq, nhead, B)
    # (dc, dq, nhead, B) => (dc*nhead, dq, B)
    A = permutedims(A, [1, 3, 2, 4])
    A = reshape(A, :, size(A, 3), size(A, 4))
    mla.denseOV(A), scores 
end
{% endhighlight %}

Test that these give the same result:
{% highlight julia %}
X0 = randn(Float32, dim_model, N, batch_dim)
mask = make_causal_mask(ones(N, N));
A_naive, scores_naive = mla_naive(mla, X0, X0; mask=mask, use_cache=true);
A_absorb, scores_absorb = mla_absorb(mla, X0, X0; mask=mask, use_cache=true);
isapprox(A_absorb, A_naive) # true
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="mla-rope">3.6 Decoupled RoPE</h3>

The last enhancement DeepSeek adds is [RoPE][RoPE_2021].
One issue with RoPE however is that it breaks the absorption property described above.
To prove this, RoPE can be represented as a series of matrix multiplications on each column in an input matrix $X$:

$$
\text{RoPE}(X) = \begin{bmatrix} R_1 X_1 & R_2 X_2 & ... & R_n X_n \end{bmatrix}
\label{eq:RoPE}
\tag{3.4.1}
$$

Applying this to the scores equation:
$$
\begin{align}
S &= \text{RoPE}(K)^T\text{RoPE}(Q) \\
  &= \text{RoPE}(W^{UK}C^{KV})^T \text{RoPE}(W^{UQ}C^Q) \\
  &= \begin{bmatrix} R_1 W^{UK}_1 C^{KV}_1 & ... & R_n W^{UK}_n C^{KV}_n \end{bmatrix}^T \\
  &\phantom{=x} \begin{bmatrix} R_1 W^{UQ}_1 C^Q_1 & ... & R_n W^{UQ}_n C^Q_n \end{bmatrix} \\
\implies S_{ij} &= (C^{KV}_{i})^T (W^{UK}_i)^T R_i^T R_j W^{UQ}_j C^{Q}_j
\end{align}
\label{eq:absorb_RoPE}
\tag{3.4.2}
$$

which shows that the rotation matrices will appear right in the middle of the product.

DeepSeek's solution is to concatenate another matrix to the bottom of the key $K$ and query $Q$ respectively and only apply RoPE to these matrices.
Furthermore, because the new matrix $K^R$ will also need to be cached, they share it across all heads.
To put it another way, $K^R$ will be broadcasted across the head dimension during multiplication.
So for each head $h$:

$$
\begin{align}
K_h &= \begin{bmatrix} W^{UK}_h C^{KV} \\ \text{RoPE}(W^{KR} X) \end{bmatrix} \\
Q_h &= \begin{bmatrix} W^{UQ}_h C^{Q} \\ \text{RoPE}(W^{QR}_h C^{Q}) \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\label{eq:MLA_RoPE}
\tag{3.4.3}
$$

where $W^{KR} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_R \times d}$ and $W^{QR} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_R H \times d_c}$. This means that $K,Q \in \mathbb{R}^{(d_h + d_R) \times n \times H \times B}$.
The cache will consist of both $C^{KV}$ and $K^R$ for a total size of $(d_c + d_R) \times N \times B$ bytes per layer.

Very conveniently, this results in an addition between the original and embedded scores:

$$
\begin{align}
S_h &= K^T Q \\
  &= \begin{bmatrix} (K^0)^T & (K^{R})^T \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} Q^0 \\ Q^{R} \end{bmatrix} \\
  &=  (K^0)^T Q^0 + (K^{R})^T Q^{R}
\end{align}
\label{eq:MLA_RoPE_scores_}
\tag{3.4.4}
$$

which means that these results can be calculated separately. Note that $S_h$ must now be scaled by $1/\sqrt{d_h + d_R}$ instead of $1/\sqrt{d_h}$.

<h3 id="rope-code">3.7 Code</h3>

I will detail some of the code here. For the full code, see [MultiHeadLatentAttention.jl](https://github.com/LiorSinai/TransformersLite.jl/blob/feature/mla/src/MultiHeadLatentAttention.jl).

Here is a Julia implementation of RoPE:

{% highlight julia %}
struct RoPE{T}
    base::Int
    dim::Int
    seq_length::Int
    freqs_complex::Matrix{Complex{T}}
end

RoPE(dim::Int, max_seq_length::Int; base::Int=10_000) = RoPE(Float32, dim, max_seq_length; base=base)

function RoPE(T::DataType, dim::Int, max_seq_length::Int; base::Int=10_000)
    @assert dim % 2 == 0 "Require even dim"
    Œ∏ = 1 ./ (base .^ ((0:2:(dim - 2)) / dim))
    angles = Œ∏ * transpose(0:(max_seq_length-1))
    freqs = map(x -> reverse(sincos(x)), angles)
    freqs_complex = map(cs -> Complex(cs...), freqs)
    RoPE{T}(base, dim, max_seq_length, freqs_complex)
end
{% endhighlight %}

The forward pass can be calculated with matrices, but the RoPE authors gave a more efficient implementation with complex numbers:
{% highlight julia %}
(r::RoPE)(x::AbstractArray) = apply_rope(x, r.freqs_complex[:, 1:size(x, 2)])
(r::RoPE)(x::AbstractArray, indices) = apply_rope(x, r.freqs_complex[:, indices])

function apply_rope(x::AbstractArray{T}, freqs_complex::AbstractMatrix{<:Complex{T}}) where T
    x_complex = reinterpret(Complex{T}, x)
    rx_complex = freqs_complex .* x_complex
    T.(reinterpret(T, rx_complex))
end
{% endhighlight %}

Then add the `embedding`, `denseQR` and `denseKR` layers to the `MultiHeadLatentAttention` struct.

The embeddings are applied as follows:
{% highlight julia %}
function _apply_embeddings(mla::MultiHeadLatentAttention, key::A3, cq::A3, idx::UnitRange{Int}) where {T, A3 <: AbstractArray{T, 3}}
    dim_lora, dq, batch_dim = size(cq)
    kr = mla.denseKR(key)
    qr = mla.denseQR(cq)
    kr = mla.embedding(kr, idx) # size(kr) == (dr, dkv, B)
    qr = permutedims(reshape(qr, :, mla.nhead, dq, batch_dim), (1, 3, 2, 4)) # (dr*nhead, dq, B) => (dr, dq, nhead, B)
    qr = mla.embedding(qr, idx)
    kr, qr
end
kr, qr = _apply_embeddings(mla, key, cq, start_pos:end_pos)
{% endhighlight %}

Note that embedding is done per the head, hence the reshaping of `qr`.

For the naive method, concatenate along the head dimension. This requires reshaping for `qr` and repeating `kr`.
{% highlight julia %}
    Q, K = _cat_decoupled_embedding(mla.nhead, Q, qr, K, kr)
{% endhighlight %}

where:
{% highlight julia %}
function _cat_decoupled_embedding(
    nhead::Int, Qin::A3, Qr::A4, Kin::A3, kr::A3
    ) where {T, A3 <: AbstractArray{T, 3}, A4 <: AbstractArray{T, 4}}
    dhq, dq, B = size(Qin)
    dhk, dkv, B = size(Kin)
    Q = reshape(
        cat(reshape(Qin, :, nhead, dq, B), permutedims(Qr, (1, 3, 2, 4)), dims=1),
        : , dq, B)
    Kr = repeat(Flux.unsqueeze(kr, dims=2), outer=(1, 2, 1, 1))
    K = reshape(
        cat(reshape(Kin, :, nhead, dkv, B), reshape(Kr, :, nhead, dkv, B), dims=1),
        :, dkv, B)
    Q, K
end
{% endhighlight %}

Then continue as before.

With absorption, broadcast batched multiply `kr` and `qr` and add to the original attention:

{% highlight julia %}
    krT = Flux.unsqueeze(permutedims(kr, (2, 1, 3)), dims=3) # (dr, dkv, B) => (dkv, dr, 1, 1B)
    atten_base = broadcasted_batched_mul(keyT, broadcasted_batched_mul(W_KQ, cq_))
    atten_embed = broadcasted_batched_mul(krT, qr)
    atten = one(T)/convert(T, sqrt(dh + dr)) .* (atten_base + atten_embed)
{% endhighlight %}

## Conclusion

Overall, I think MLA is a smart and useful idea. 
However, after having explored it in depth, I am more critical of their enhancements.

The basic premise of Multi-Head Latent Attention is simple.
It compresses the input matrix so that a single smaller $C^{KV}$ matrix can be stored instead of the key $K$ and value $V$ matrices.
It then uncompresses this matrix into $K$ and $V$ with two additional weight matrices.
With the appropriate compression ratio ($\frac{d_h H}{d_c}>3$) this can even give a performance boost too.
This requires no further modifications to existing MHA code.

However, to this DeepSeek adds weight absorption and decoupled RoPE.
We have seen this complicates the mathematics and requires careful dimensional analysis.
True performance gains only come with an optimised `broadcasted_batched_mul` function.
Their own open source code does not even have such optimisations.
Personally, I see no benefit to this and would recommend the naive method with RoPE applied normally.
That is, apply each of the weight matrices to their inputs individually and then apply RoPE to the entire $K$ and $Q$ matrices.

I hope you've enjoyed the post!

[^tensors]: In general multiplication is not defined for higher order arrays. But there is a set of multidimensional algebraic objects called [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor) where it is, and Einstein notation was designed for this use case.
    Confusingly, Google named their machine learning framework TensorFlow and calls higher order arrays tensors.
    So one should differentiate between machine learning tensors and geometric tensors.
    They are not the same.
    To give a simple explanation: one can think of geometric tensors as higher order arrays with severe constraints on their entries and operations because they represent geometric objects. These constraints make it harder - not easier - to code higher order arrays as geometric tensors.

[^forgive]: Indices for dimensions are shown when they are relevant and left out when they're not. For example, the row index (along the embedding dimension) is generally ignored so $X_j$ is the $j$th column/token of $X$. But then later for the scores I'll use $X_{i,j}$ because both indices represent a position in the token sequence. But then later I use $X_h$ to indicate the $h$th head of $X$ which is along the 3rd dimension. Please forgive me for this and other abuses of matrix notation in this post.

[^matrix_complexity]: This is the naive matrix multiplication algorithm. For sizes $n \times d$ and $d \times m$, there are $d$ multiplications for each of the $nm$ elements and $d-1$ additions (no addition for the first element), so there are $nm(2d-1)$ operations in total.
